## Code for the paper  titled Information Bottleneck Disentanglement Based Sparse Representation for Fair Classification

### We proposes the Information Bottleneck Disentanglement Based Sparse Representation algorithm to ensure the fairness of extracted features.

**(a) the distribution of $z_c$ under $c$, different colors represent different category labels**

**(b) the distribution of $z_c$ under $s$, different colors represent different sensitive labels**

**(c) the distribution of $z_s$ under $c$, different colors represent different category labels**

**(d) the distribution of $z_s$ under $s$, different colors represent different sensitive labels** 

### The t-SNE visualization of $\mathbf{z}_c$ and $\mathbf{z}_s$  corresponding to 5000 samples in the MNIST-ROT test dataset. From (a), $\mathbf{z}_{c}$ can be gathered to form different sample clusters according to $c$. While the rotation angle label, as shown in (b), can only produce a relatively uniform distribution, test samples with different rotation angles are distributed in each cluster. Similar rules are also reflected in the (d) and (c).

#### A released version will coming soon...
